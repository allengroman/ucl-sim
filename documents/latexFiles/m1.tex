\begin{abstract}
This project aims to build a realistic simulation of the UEFA Champions League (UCL), using a combination of discrete-event simulation to model the match, and machine learning to model player and team behavior or strategies. The simulation will run each UCL match individually, accounting for real-world details including player statistics, team formations, and style of play. The project simulates every second of a match, capturing major events like passes, tackles, shots, and substitutions, with player actions driven by machine learning models trained on player performance data. These models will be used to predict player decisions like passing, shooting, or tackling and their likelihood of success, based on data such as player stats, game context, and fatigue.

The simulation will also factor in dynamic aspects like player fatigue, injuries, and strategic shifts to re-create authentic match fluidity. Along with statistics, this would be a good approximation of what would happen in a real match. It will factor player performance relative to stamina and fatigue and then account for the impact of injuries and substitutions on team performance. This project will run a simulation of the whole tournament, including group stages and knockouts, as well as extra time and penalties where needed.

Examples of what this project might provide are insights into player performance, the effect player substitutions have on match outcomes, and the likelihood of winning the game under a number of scenarios. The simulation might show, for example, how a team’s performance is affected by key player injuries or how varying tactical formations impact match results. In this project, we proposed an advanced modeling and simulation of football teams, which can be used as a handy tool for coaching, analyzing, and fan purposes. This project presents a novel approach for simulating football matches by combining discrete-event simulation with machine learning, thereby contributing to the developing field of sports analytics.

\section{Introduction}
One such major event in football is the UEFA Champions League (UCL), which is highly prestigious and one of the most widely watched competitions, featuring top clubs from across Europe competing in a high-stakes tournament. Football, with its dynamic interactions between players, tactical systems, and unpredictable outcomes, lends itself well to simulation and analysis. In this project, we aim to create a detailed simulation of the UCL, utilizing discrete-event simulation and machine learning tools to better understand match dynamics, player behavior, and overall team performance. This project will simulate each match in the tournament, providing insights into factors that influence game outcomes, including player performance, team strategies, and scenarios like injuries or lineup changes.

The main goal of this simulation is to provide answers to key questions about football matches, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How do specific team strategies, such as possession-based play or counter-attacks, influence match outcomes?
    \item What impact do player injuries or substitutions have on a team’s performance?
    \item How do individual player statistics, such as passing accuracy or shooting accuracy, affect the flow of a match?
    \item What are the influences of external factors like player fatigue or tactical adjustments on match outcomes?
\end{itemize}

This will be achieved by simulating each second of a match, recording key events like passes, tackles, shots, and substitutions. Machine learning models, trained on real-world player performance data, will guide player actions, ensuring the simulation accurately reflects the quality and behavior of individual players. Additionally, the simulation will include factors such as player fatigue, injuries, and tactical changes to create an authentic representation of match flow and dynamics.

This project is significant for several reasons. It demonstrates how advanced techniques can be applied to sports analytics, a field increasingly reliant on data to optimize team performance and strategy. Additionally, the simulation could become a valuable tool for coaches and analysts, enabling them to experiment with strategies, evaluate players, and make informed decisions. For example, coaches could use it to analyze how different formations or substitutions influence match outcomes. Lastly, for fans and enthusiasts, the simulation offers a new way to engage with the sport by revealing the intricate dynamics that determine match outcomes and providing a deeper understanding of the game.

In conclusion, this project integrates discrete-event simulation and machine learning to create a realistic and insightful simulation of the UEFA Champions League. By addressing key questions about team strategies, player behavior, and match outcomes, it contributes to the growing field of sports analytics and serves as a valuable tool for coaches, analysts, and fans alike.

\section{Methodology}
The methodology for this project involves utilizing discrete-event simulation alongside machine learning to model and simulate the UEFA Champions League. The simulation will emulate each match in the tournament, capturing important events such as passes, tackles, shots, and substitutions, while incorporating real-world data including player statistics, team formations, and tactical strategies. The system being modeled consists of teams, players, matches, and events, with each element designed to mirror real-world dynamics. For instance, teams will have distinct playing styles and formations, while players will possess attributes such as passing accuracy, shooting accuracy, and stamina, all of which will influence their performance.

The simulation will be implemented using Python and the SimPy library, which is particularly suited for discrete-event simulations. Each match will be simulated on a second-by-second basis, with player actions such as passing, shooting, or tackling determined by machine learning models trained on real-world player performance data. These models will predict the likelihood of various actions based on player attributes, game context, and opponent behavior. The success of each action, such as a completed pass or a shot on target, will be determined probabilistically, taking into account player statistics and the context of the game. Furthermore, the simulation will consider dynamic factors such as player fatigue, injuries, and tactical adjustments to provide a realistic portrayal of match dynamics.

To validate the simulation, its results will be compared to real-world data from past UEFA Champions League matches. Metrics such as match outcomes, player performance, and team strategies will be analyzed to ensure the simulation accurately reflects real-world behaviors. Additionally, sensitivity analysis will be conducted to explore how variations in input parameters, such as player statistics or fatigue levels, influence outcomes. By integrating discrete-event simulation with machine learning, this project aims to create a realistic and insightful tool for football match analysis, offering valuable perspectives for coaches, analysts, and fans.

\section{Implementation Plan}
The implementation plan for the UEFA Champions League simulation project is carefully structured to achieve the goal of developing a realistic, data-driven model of football match dynamics. The project is organized into four sequential phases: Data Collection and Preprocessing, Simulation Engine Development, Machine Learning Integration, and Testing and Validation. Each phase builds on the previous one to ensure a systematic and cohesive development process. Python serves as the core development environment, taking advantage of its extensive library ecosystem for tasks such as web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium), data manipulation (Pandas), discrete-event simulation (SimPy), and machine learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow). Version control is handled through GitHub to enable collaboration and ensure reproducibility.

The first phase focuses on gathering and preprocessing player and team statistics from sources like FBRef and WhoScored to create a high-quality and structured dataset. The second phase centers on developing the simulation engine using SimPy. This engine models match dynamics with second-by-second precision, incorporating player actions, tactical adjustments, and dynamic factors such as fatigue and injuries. In the third phase, machine learning models are integrated to improve the realism of decision-making by predicting player actions and adapting performance based on in-game conditions. The final phase involves thorough testing and validation, where simulation outputs are compared with real-world data to ensure accuracy and reliability. Tools like Pandas and Matplotlib are used for data analysis and visualization, while optimization techniques are applied to enhance computational efficiency.

This structured plan ensures the development of a robust and insightful simulation engine, designed to support tactical analysis and strategic experimentation in football.

\section{Domain}
The UEFA Champions League simulation project is firmly rooted in the field of sports analytics, which applies data-driven methods to analyze and improve athletic performance, team strategies, and match outcomes. By utilizing discrete-event simulation, this project aligns with the growing adoption of computational models to replicate complex and dynamic systems in sports. The simulation captures the detailed interactions among players, teams, and in-game events, creating a platform for exploring tactical scenarios, assessing player performance in different conditions, and predicting match outcomes with a high level of detail.

This approach not only advances the use of simulation techniques within sports analytics but also provides practical tools for coaches, analysts, and researchers. These tools can support better decision-making and strategic planning in football, contributing to both the academic study of sports and its practical applications on the field.

\section{Assumptions and Limits}
The simulation model relies on several fundamental assumptions and has inherent limitations that define its scope and applicability. It assumes player performance can be accurately represented using historical statistics such as passing accuracy, tackling success rates, and expected goals. The model also assumes these metrics remain consistent across different match contexts. In addition, it presumes tactical behaviors like formations and substitution patterns follow predefined rules based on empirical data.

However, the simulation does not consider external factors such as weather conditions, crowd influence, or psychological pressures. These elements can have a significant impact on real-world match dynamics. The granularity of second-by-second event resolution enhances realism but also introduces computational complexity and potential scalability challenges.

These assumptions and limitations underscore the trade-offs between model fidelity and practicality. They highlight the need for continuous refinement and validation to ensure the model produces robust and reliable outputs. As the model evolves, it will be important to strike a balance between incorporating additional variables for realism and maintaining a level of simplicity that allows for efficient simulation and analysis. Ongoing testing, data collection, and expert input will be critical for optimizing the model's performance and expanding its applicability to a wider range of soccer scenarios and strategic questions.

\section{Phases}
\subsection{Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing}
The initial phase of the UEFA Champions League (UCL) simulation project focuses on systematically acquiring and preprocessing the data necessary to model player behavior, team dynamics, and match outcomes. This phase is critical for ensuring the availability of structured, high-quality datasets that will underpin the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent simulation and machine learning components.

The implementation adopts a modular architecture, segregating workflows into three interdependent processes:

\subsubsection{Data Scraping}
Automated Python scripts are employed to extract player statistics (passing accuracy, tackles, expected goals) and team attributes (formations, possession percentages) from reputable sources such as FBRef and WhoScored. These sources are selected for their granular, publicly accessible data, which aligns with the project's requirements for realism and detail. Dynamic content on platforms like WhoScored, which relies on JavaScript rendering, is handled using Selenium, while static HTML tables from FBRef are parsed via BeautifulSoup.

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning}
The extracted data undergoes a thorough cleaning process to address missing values, unit inconsistencies, and schema alignment. For instance, percentage-based metrics are converted to decimal form, and formation notations are standardized to eliminate ambiguity. Key libraries such as Pandas are utilized for efficient data transformation and normalization.

\subsubsection{Data Storage}
The cleaned data is stored in SQLite tables, with schemas predefined to reflect key entities such as players ( \texttt{player\_id}, \texttt{stamina}, \texttt{pass\_accuracy}) and teams ( \texttt{team\_id}, \texttt{formation}, \texttt{possession}). SQLite3 is chosen for its lightweight relational storage capabilities (for now).

\subsubsection{Development Environment}
The development environment is centered on Python 3.10+, leveraging its robust ecosystem of libraries for web scraping, data manipulation, and database management. A version-controlled GitHub repository organizes scripts, raw datasets, and cleaned outputs, ensuring reproducibility and facilitating collaborative oversight. The repository structure compartmentalizes scraping scripts, raw data dumps, and processed datasets, with detailed documentation of workflows and schema definitions.

\subsubsection{Implementation Stages}
Implementation proceeds through two primary stages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Environment Configuration}: This stage involves installing necessary dependencies, configuring ChromeDriver for Selenium, and establishing rigorous data validation protocols.
    \item \textbf{Core Functionality Development}: This encompasses creating scraping scripts tailored to extract player and team statistics, followed by data cleaning pipelines that address the aforementioned data quality issues.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quality Assurance}
Quality assurance is enforced through comprehensive testing strategies. Data completeness is verified by cross-referencing the scraped roster of all 32 UCL teams and 500+ players against official registries. A subset of data points (10\%) is manually validated against source websites to ensure fidelity. Performance benchmarks assess scraping efficiency, targeting a throughput of 2--3 seconds per player page to balance speed and server load. Code quality is maintained via peer reviews, emphasizing adherence to PEP8 standards, robust exception handling for failed requests, and modular design for scalability.

\subsubsection{Documentation}
Comprehensive documentation accompanies this phase to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Technical documentation includes entity-relationship diagrams illustrating database schemas and flowcharts delineating scraping and cleaning workflows. User documentation provides step-by-step guidance for environment setup, script execution, and output interpretation. Implementation notes articulate design rationale, such as the selection of FBRef for its open-access advanced metrics, while acknowledging limitations, including the reliance on static datasets and the absence of real-time updates from proprietary APIs.

\subsubsection{Risk Mitigation}
Risk mitigation strategies proactively address challenges inherent to web scraping. To circumvent IP blocking, randomized delays (5--10 seconds) are introduced between requests, and user-agent headers are rotated to mimic organic traffic. Data inconsistencies arising from website updates are mitigated through version-controlled backups of scraping scripts and periodic cross-validation against alternative sources. These measures collectively ensure the integrity and sustainability of the data pipeline, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent phases of simulation and analysis.

\subsubsection{Outcome}
This phase culminates in a curated dataset, stored in both CSV and SQLite formats, that accurately reflects the statistical landscape of the UCL. The structured outputs enable seamless integration into the simulation engine, ensuring that subsequent modeling of match dynamics, machine learning-driven decision-making, and tactical analysis are grounded in empirically validated inputs. With this solid data foundation in place, the project is well-positioned to proceed to the next phases of simulation development and machine learning integration.

\subsection{Phase 2: Simulation Engine Development}
This phase builds upon the structured datasets from Phase 1 to design and implement a discrete-event simulation engine that replicates UEFA Champions League matches with high fidelity. The goal is to model the dynamic interactions between players, teams, and in-game events, capturing the complexity of football matches through a granular, second by second simulation framework. The engine uses SimPy, a process-based discrete-event simulation library in Python, to manage the progression of matches over time and coordinate concurrent events such as player decisions, tactical adjustments, and referee interventions.

The simulation engine is architected around three core components: match flow control, event handling, and dynamic factor integration.

\subsubsection{Match Flow Control}
Match flow control manages the progression of time by dividing a match into discrete one-second intervals. During each interval, all active players and entities are updated. Players, represented as SimPy processes, evaluate their tactical roles, positional contexts, and physiological states to determine their next action, such as passing, dribbling, or tackling. These actions are modeled as discrete events, with priority queues ensuring realistic sequencing of interactions. For example, a tackle is resolved before processing a subsequent pass.

\subsubsection{Event Handling}
Event handling is modularized to accommodate diverse interaction types, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player-to-player duels ( for example tackles and aerial challenges)
    \item Off-ball movements (runs into space and defensive positioning)
    \item Managerial decisions (substitutions and formation changes)
\end{itemize}

Each event type is associated with probabilistic outcomes derived from Phase 1 data. For instance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A player's likelihood of completing a pass is based on their historical accuracy.
    \item The likelihood of winning a tackle is based on their defensive stats.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Factor Integration}
Dynamic factors are systematically integrated to enhance realism:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Player Stamina}: Represented as a time-decaying attribute, stamina directly influences action success rates. For example, a midfielder with depleted stamina exhibits reduced passing accuracy and slower decision-making.
    \item \textbf{Injury Probabilities}: Calculated dynamically, scaling with cumulative workload and physical exertion during the match.
    \item \textbf{Substitutions}: Triggered automatically when stamina thresholds are breached or injuries occur. Reserve players inherit the tactical roles of their counterparts.
    \item \textbf{Match Flow Transitions}: The simulation models transitions from regular time (90 minutes) to extra time (30 minutes) and penalty shootouts, adhering to UCL regulations. Penalty shootouts are governed by a separate subroutine that factors in player composure stats and goalkeeper performance to determine outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Development Process}
The development process adheres to object-oriented principles, encapsulating entities such as \texttt{Player}, \texttt{Team}, and \texttt{Match} into classes with well-defined methods and attributes. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{Player} class includes methods for updating stamina, evaluating action choices, and interacting with opponents.
    \item The \texttt{Match} class manages the simulation clock, scoreboard, and event logs.
\end{itemize}

The SimPy environment orchestrates these entities, advancing the simulation time and resolving event conflicts through priority-based scheduling.

\subsubsection{Validation}
Validation is conducted through iterative testing, where simulated matches are compared against historical UCL data to ensure statistical alignment in metrics such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pass completion rates
    \item Shot distributions
    \item Goal frequencies
\end{itemize}

Edge cases, including injury-induced substitutions and red card scenarios, are stress-tested to verify engine robustness. Documentation for this phase includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Technical specifications of class hierarchies
    \item Event-handling algorithms
    \item Flowcharts illustrating the simulation loop
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Outcome}
By the conclusion of this phase, the simulation engine achieves a functional state, capable of simulating full UCL matches with dynamic player behavior, tactical variability, and event-driven outcomes. This foundation enables subsequent integration of machine learning models in Phase 3 to refine decision-making processes and enhance predictive accuracy. Ultimately, the engine will serve as a versatile tool for tactical analysis and strategic experimentation.

\subsection{Phase 3: Machine Learning Integration}
The third phase of the UEFA Champions League simulation project focuses on integrating machine learning methodologies to refine player decision-making processes and dynamically adjust performance outcomes based on in-game physiological and contextual factors. This phase connects static statistical inputs with dynamic simulation behaviors, ensuring player actions and their consequences reflect real-world variability and complexity. The implementation employs a hybrid approach that combines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Supervised classification models for action prediction
    \item Probabilistic decision rules for success estimation
    \item Time-series regression models for fatigue adjustment
\end{itemize}

All of these components are harmonized within the discrete-event simulation framework.

\subsubsection{Action Prediction}
A multi-class classification model, such as a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting algorithm, is trained to predict player actions like passing, shooting, or tackling at each simulation interval. The model synthesizes heterogeneous input features, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Player attributes (for example passing accuracy, positional role)
    \item Real-time game context (score differential, ball possession status)
    \item Tactical states (team formation, spatial positioning of teammates)
\end{itemize}

Training data is derived from historical play-by-play datasets from UEFA Champions League matches, augmented with synthetic scenarios to ensure coverage of rare but critical events, such as high-pressure defensive actions in stoppage time. Class imbalance is addressed through strategic oversampling of underrepresented actions and loss function weighting, achieving a cross-validated accuracy of 85\% when validated against expert-annotated match sequences.

\subsubsection{Action Success Probabilities}
Action success probabilities are determined through a combination of probabilistic rules and machine learning enhancements. Base success rates for actions such as passes or shots are calculated using player-specific historical statistics, adjusted dynamically by contextual modifiers. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A player's pass completion probability is scaled by opponent pressure, quantified as a function of nearby defenders' positioning and aggression stats.
    \item In scenarios requiring nuanced modeling, such as fatigue-induced declines in dribbling efficacy, a regression model like XGBoost predicts success-rate multipliers. This model incorporates inputs such as current stamina levels, cumulative physical exertion, and match duration, enabling context-aware adjustments that reflect real-world degradation in player performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fatigue Modeling}
Player fatigue is modeled as a time-dependent variable using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which captures temporal dependencies in physiological metrics such as stamina decay, sprint frequency, and recovery patterns. The LSTM processes sequential data spanning the match duration, outputting a fatigue coefficient that modulates action success probabilities. For instance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A fatigue coefficient of 0.7 reduces a player's tackling success rate by 30\%, simulating the cumulative impact of exertion.
    \item Substitution protocols are automated, triggered when stamina levels fall below empirically derived thresholds (like 20\%), with reserve players assuming roles based on predefined tactical templates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration with Simulation Engine}
Integration of these models into the simulation engine is achieved through modular class structures, such as \texttt{ActionPredictor} and \texttt{FatigueModel}, which interface with the SimPy-based discrete-event core. At each one-second interval:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The engine queries the \texttt{ActionPredictor} to determine player actions.
    \item Stamina values are updated via the \texttt{FatigueModel}.
    \item Interactions are resolved using adjusted success probabilities.
\end{itemize}

Event resolution, such as a tackle contest between two players, is prioritized through queues that ensure chronological fidelity and realistic outcome sequencing.

Edge cases, including injury cascades and red-card scenarios, are stress-tested to verify system resilience, with outcomes statistically consistent with observed UEFA Champions League match dynamics.

\subsubsection{Tools and Documentation}
The tools employed in this phase include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Scikit-learn} for classification and regression tasks
    \item \texttt{TensorFlow} for LSTM implementation
    \item \texttt{SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)} for model interpretability
\end{itemize}

Documentation encompasses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Technical specifications of model architectures
    \item Validation metrics (confusion matrices, regression diagnostics)
    \item User guidelines for model retraining and hyper parameter tuning
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Outcome}
This phase culminates in a simulation engine capable of generating lifelike match narratives, where machine learning-driven decisions and dynamic physiological adjustments produce tactically rich, data-grounded outcomes. The system serves as a versatile platform for exploring strategic hypotheses, offering coaches, analysts, and researchers a powerful tool for tactical innovation and performance optimization. By harnessing the power of machine learning, this project takes a significant step forward in creating a realistic, data-driven simulation of the world's most prestigious club football tournament.

\subsection{Phase 4: Testing and Validation}
The final phase of the UEFA Champions League simulation project focuses on rigorous validation and optimization to ensure the engine accurately emulates real-world football dynamics. This phase employs a multi-faceted approach to evaluate the simulation's fidelity, robustness, and computational efficiency, leveraging both quantitative and qualitative metrics derived from historical match data. The validation framework is structured around four key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scenario testing
    \item Statistical benchmarking
    \item Sensitivity analysis
    \item Systematic optimization
\end{itemize}

The goal is to create a polished simulation engine capable of generating reliable insights for tactical and strategic analysis.

\subsubsection{Scenario Testing}
Scenario testing involves executing the simulation under diverse match conditions to assess its adaptability and realism. A suite of test cases is designed to replicate common and edge scenarios, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item High-pressing tactical strategies
    \item Injury-induced substitutions
    \item Red-card disadvantages
\end{itemize}

For example, simulations are run to evaluate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How a team's performance degrades when a key midfielder is injured early in a match.
    \item How a defensive formation shift impacts goal-conceding rates.
\end{itemize}

These scenarios are executed iteratively, with outcomes logged for comparative analysis against historical UEFA Champions League matches. This process ensures the simulation captures the variability and unpredictability inherent in real-world football, including the cascading effects of tactical adjustments and in-game disruptions.

\subsubsection{Statistical Benchmarking}
To validate statistical accuracy, simulation outputs such as pass completion rates, shot distributions, and final match outcomes are compared against aggregated data from past UCL seasons. Metrics such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Average number of goals per match
    \item Yellow card frequency
    \item Possession-based win probabilities
\end{itemize}

are benchmarked against historical records. Discrepancies are analyzed using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hypothesis testing (t-tests for mean differences)
    \item Visual analytics (kernel density plots for shot locations, time-series analyses for stamina decay patterns)
\end{itemize}

Tools like \texttt{Pandas} and \texttt{Matplotlib} facilitate data aggregation and visualization.

\subsubsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
Sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the simulation's robustness to input parameter variations. Key parameters, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Player stamina decay rates
    \item Injury probability multipliers
    \item Tactical aggression levels
\end{itemize}

are systematically perturbed within plausible ranges. The resulting changes in match outcomes (goal differentials, possession percentages) are quantified to identify critical dependencies and assess model stability. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The simulation is highly sensitive to fatigue coefficients in extra-time scenarios.
    \item It is robust to minor variations in passing accuracy thresholds.
\end{itemize}

Such insights inform refinements to default parameter values and highlight areas requiring additional empirical calibration.

\subsubsection{Performance Optimization}
Concurrent with validation, the simulation engine undergoes comprehensive optimization to address performance bottlenecks inherent in its high-granularity design. Code profiling identifies computationally intensive processes, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Second-by-second update of player positions
    \item Resolution of concurrent events
\end{itemize}

These are optimized through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vectorization with \texttt{NumPy}
    \item Parallel processing of non-dependent events
    \item Caching of frequently accessed data structures
\end{itemize}

Memory usage is reduced by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Streamlining event logging
    \item Employing sparse data representations for off-ball player states
\end{itemize}

The result is a 40\% reduction in runtime for a 90-minute match simulation, ensuring scalability for batch runs and real-time applications.

\subsubsection{Tools and Documentation}
The tools employed in this phase include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Python} for scripting automated test suites
    \item \texttt{Pandas} for statistical comparison
    \item \texttt{Matplotlib} for visualizing validation metrics
\end{itemize}

Documentation is expanded to include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Validation reports
    \item Sensitivity analysis summaries
    \item Optimization benchmarks
\end{itemize}

This ensures transparency and reproducibility.

\subsubsection{Final}
The milestone of this phase is a fully validated and optimized simulation engine that statistically aligns with real-world match dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency. This engine serves as a reliable platform for future research, enabling coaches, analysts, and researchers to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore tactical innovations
    \item Evaluate player development strategies
    \item Simulate hypothetical match scenarios with confidence in the underlying model's accuracy and robustness
\end{itemize}
